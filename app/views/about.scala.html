<p>About Archie: Canadian, software engineer</p>
<p>About Charlotte: Wisconsonite, psychiatrist, lover of Jane Austen and Charlotte Bronte,</p>
<p>Thanks to their good friends Laura, Ben, and Peter, Archie and Charlotte met one cold March evening in Boston's South End. Discovering that they were actually neighbors on the other side of town, they decided to share a cab back -- Archie took this opportunity to ask for Charlotte's number so that he could take her on a "Kendall 101" tour of the neighborhood, where Charlotte had just moved in and he had lived for the past 5 years.</p>
<p>The years since then have involved Archie teaching Charlotte to love hockey, Charlotte teaching Archie to enjoy cheesy TV marathons, lots of skiing/snowboarding, mediocre soccer playing, great food, travel, laughs, and fun. Then on April 18th, 2014 Archie recreated their first date -- that same tour of Kendall Square's best food and sights -- at the end of which they decided to spend the rest of their lives together.</p>
